      <main id="main">
      <p>I’m a first-year master’s student at the University of Michigan School of Information with a focus on agile software development.</p>
      <p>I’ve always been curious about what makes people tick, so I chose to study psychology and economics as an undergraduate, primarily focusing my studies within behavioral economics. While working at an automotive advertising agency after graduation, I had the opportunity to examine consumer behavior in-depth to optimize our campaigns. I was also able to apply several new technologies within the programmatic media space to shape our voice and brand. This was where I found my niche at the intersection of psychology and tech, and these experiences created a natural segue into the field of UX. I’m passionate about design that facilitates positive social change.</p>
      <p>During my free time, you can find me running, cooking, or spending time with family and friends.</p>
